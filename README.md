# Light-Curve-Generator
Series of functions utilising the Fermi Tools to automatically produce and update gamma ray light curves for a range of pulsars. Project is still a WIP

This is an old repo made for my undergaduate project. The idea was to set up a pipeline to automatically pull gamma ray flux data from the Fermi space telescope
and produce light curves for pulsars confirmed/suspected to be transitional.

The hope is such a pipeline could be an early warning system to let us know where to point radio and optical telescopes to try catch transitions as they happen.
It will be finished one day, I got distracted by weak lensing stuff.
